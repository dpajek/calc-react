# calc-react

This is a simple calculator built with React. Mostly, I was experimenting with state hooks.

I also setup automatic deployment to GitHub Pages, based on [this example](https://dev.to/dyarleniber/setting-up-a-ci-cd-workflow-on-github-actions-for-a-react-app-with-github-pages-and-codecov-4hnp).

Here's a [live version](https://dpajek.github.io/calc-react/).
